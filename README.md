# BOILERPLATE FULL STACK APP
### Description
* This is a basic es6 full stack application with a React Front End and an Express Back End.
* The Frontend and the backend are independent aplications in the same directory to easily remove one or the other depending on need.
* There is no DB as DB choices can vary a bit depending on need, so this can be added as needed, but easiest DB setup is an Atlas Mongo CloudDB.
* Hopefully this is a good template for most fullstack take home projects with an emphasis on React and Node.
#### Happy Coding!!!
